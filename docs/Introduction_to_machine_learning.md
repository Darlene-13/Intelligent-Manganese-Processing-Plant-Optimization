#### MACHINE LEARNING

- Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses in the development of models and algorithsm that let computers lear from data without being explicity programmmed for every task.
- In simple terms ML teaches systems to think and understand like humans by learning from data

##### IMPORTANT STEPS IN MACHINE LEARNING
- Data Collection
- Explanatory data analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

Machine Learning is mainly divided to three core types:
- Supervised Learning: This is the process of training models using labelled data or supervised data or classify new and unseen data
- Unsupervised Learning: This is the process where machines have to find patterns in unlabelled data, like clustering or dimensionality function,
- Reinforcement Learning: This is where machines tend to learn through trial and error to maximize rewards that are ideal for decision-making.


N/B: We have additional types like self-supervised Learning that is often considered as a subset of unsupervised learning but has grown with time to its own filed due to its success in training large scale models. It tends to generate its own labels from data without mnual labelling.
- We also have semi-supervised-Learning: This approach tends to combine a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabelled data, this is useful when the labelled data is expensive or time-consuming


#### MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE
##### 1. DATA PRE-PROCESSING
a. ML Workflow
- Machine Learning LifeCycle
- Machine Learning LifeCcycle is a structured process that tends to define how machine learning models are developed, deployed and maintained. All this steps
tend to ensure that the models is accurate, reliable and scalable.
  - Problem Definition
  - Data Collection 
  - Data Cleaning and PreProcessing
  - Explanatory Data analysis. 
  - Feature engineering and selection 
  - Model selection 
  - Model Training 
  - Model Evaluation and Tuning 
  - Model deployment 
  - Monitoring model and its maintenance


By following the lifecycle then we can:
- Define clear objectives, scope and succcess criteria to ensure that that ML project has a clear direction
- Gather relevant and diverse and sufficient datasets from reliable sources to support model training.
- Handle missing values, outliers and inconsistencies while standardizing data formats for consistency
- Use Statistical visualization methods to detect trends, patterns and anomalies for deeper insights
- Transform raw features and retain only the most relevant attributes to improve accuracy and efficiency.
- Fit algorithms on prepared data, compare performance and choose the most suitable model
- -Test the model on unseen data, measure with metrics and optimize hyperparameters for robustness
- Integrate the trained model to production systems through APIs or pipelines for real world use and continuously track performances, detect data drift and retain models to ensure long term reliability.

##### PROBLEM DEFINITION
- This is the most important and first step in DS and ML: Clearly defining the business problem. A well framed problem provided the foundation for the entire lifecycle. 
Important things like project objectives, desired outcomes and the scope of the task are carefully designed during this stage.
  - Collaborate with stakeholders to understand the business goals,
  - Define the project's objetives and the scope and the success criteria
  - Ensure clarity in the desired outcomes.
